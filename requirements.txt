# This file should list all Python libraries that your project depends on
# Since the project description and provided code snippets do not indicate the use of any external libraries,
# and Python's random module (which is likely used for generating random numbers) is part of the standard library,
# this file can be left empty or with a comment indicating as such.

# No external dependencies required
