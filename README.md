# Random Number Series Generator

This project provides a simple Python script that generates a specified number of series, each containing 7 unique random numbers between 1 and 35. It's a straightforward tool that can be used for various purposes, including simulations, games, and educational projects.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. The project uses Python's standard library, so no additional installations are required.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Script

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `number_generator.py` file.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python number_generator.py.

```

4. When prompted, enter the number of series you wish to generate. For example:

```
Enter the number of series to generate: 5
```

The script will then print 5 series of 7 unique random numbers between 1 and 35 to the console.
